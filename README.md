## My process

### Built with

During this project, I learned how to center elements and images so they would be responsive in relation to the page. I also learned how to style elements using CSS.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on styling elements in such a way that is pleasing to the eye.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/defaulT.asp) - This helped me learn new useful CSS concepts. I'd recommend it to anyone trying to learn CSS.
